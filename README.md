📊 **Sales Data Analysis with Python**

This project performs insightful data analysis and visualization on a fictional retail sales dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It helps uncover patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and daily sales trends — making it ideal for beginners in data science.

📌 **Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to analyze and summarize sales data by:

- Cleaning and combining multiple raw CSV files
- Performing group-by aggregations by product, location, and date
- Visualizing top-performing products and daily trends
- Exporting processed data and charts
- (Optional) Creating a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard

---

🛠️ **Technologies & Libraries Used**

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Streamlit

🧠 **How It Works**

1. Load and clean the raw `sales.csv`, `products.csv`, and `customers.csv` files.
2. Merge and process the data to generate meaningful summaries.
3. Visualize:
   - Top products by revenue and quantity
   - Daily sales performance
   - Product-wise trends
4. Export final data:
   - `sales_data_cleaned.csv`
   - `daily_sales_summary.csv`
   - `top_products.csv`
